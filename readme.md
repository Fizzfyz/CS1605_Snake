CS1605 Course Project: Snake Game

We used StanfordCppLib to help implement this project.

## Our design:
### Extra Life
The snake gets an extra life by eating a "$".

### Faster Speed
The speed of the snake becomes faster and faster as the score increases.

### 8 Directions
W A S D -> W A S D Q E Z C
